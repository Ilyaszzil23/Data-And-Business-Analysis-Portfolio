About Me

I am Ilyas, an ambitious individual with a strong background in Business and Mathematics (Joint Honours). With a passion for data analysis and problem-solving, I am currently

My journey in programming has equipped me with essential skills such as Python, Data Visualisation, Forecasting, and Mathematical Concepts. Alongside technical skills, I have

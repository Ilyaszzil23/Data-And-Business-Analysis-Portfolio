# Ilyas Mohamed - Data / Business Analyst Portfolio

## About

I am Ilyas, an ambitious individual with a strong background in Business and Mathematics (Joint Honours). With a passion for data analysis and problem-solving, I am currently 
expanding my expertise through Business Intelligence courses on Udemy.

My journey in programming has equipped me with essential skills such as Python, Data Visualisation, Forecasting, and Mathematical Concepts. Alongside technical skills, I have
also developed strong Business Analysis capabilities, including defining business problems, gathering and analysing data, and effectively communicating insights to stakeholders.

In my current role as a Part-time Assistant Accountant, I help clients navigate financial challenges, such as Tax Returns, Business Registrations, and Tax Assessments.
I am enthusiastic about exploring emerging technologies and advancing my skills in programming. 

My ultimate goal is to become a professional Freelance Data & Business Analyst, supporting businesses in driving innovation and improving their impact on society.
I believe that with dedication, continuous learning, and perseverance, I can help businesses unlock their full potential for a better world.

## Portfolio Projects

In this section I will list data and business analytics projects briefly describing the technology stack and business technique used to solve cases.

## Basketball Free Throws

**Goal statement:** The objective to  analyse basketball free throws performance and player scoring tendencies using the  provided data. This will involve creating two matrices from the given vectors to generate three key visual insights:

1. Free Throw Attempts per Game - To assess player's frequency of attempting free throws.
2. Free Throw Accuracy - To evaluate players' efficiency in coverting free throws.
3. Player Playing Style Analysis - To identify player's scoring preferences between 2-point and 3-point shots, excluding free throws.

 This analysis aims to provide actionable insights into player performance and strong strategies.

**Code:** ['Basketball Free Throws.ipynb'](https://github.com/Ilyaszzil23/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Basketball%20Free%20Throws.ipynb)

**Raw Data:** ['BasketBall free throws-Dataset.pdf'](https://github.com/Ilyaszzil23/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/BasketBall%20free%20throws-Dataset.pdf)

**Description:** This project applied matrix manipulation techniques in Python to create visual insights about player performance. Leveraging NumPy, data was transformed into matrices representing shot attempts and success rates. Visualisation libraries such as Matplotlib were used to present clear and insightful visualisations, enhancing the understanding of player tendencies and performance.

**Skills:** data visualisation, data cleaning, matrix, computation,

**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (Offline), Matplotib, NumPy

## World Trends

**Goal statement:** The objective is to analyse and visualise the relationship between Life Expectancy and Fertility Rate across countries, categorised by region. Using Data from 1960 and 2013, the analyse will inovlve:

1. Creating Scatterplots for each year to illustrate the corrlation between Life Expectancy (y-axis) and Fertility Rate (x-axis).
2. Ensuring data manipulations are conducted in Python for auditability.
3. Providing insights into how these metrices have evolved over time, highlighting regional trends, and significant changes.

This analysis aims to support the World bank's understanding of global health and demographic shifts.

**Code:** ['World Trends.ipynb'](https://github.com/Ilyaszzil23/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/World%20Trends.ipynb)

**Raw Data:** ['Demographic-Data World trends.csv'](https://github.com/Ilyaszzil23/Portfolio-Projects/blob/main/Demographic-Data%20World%20trends.csv)

**Description:** This project utilised Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib/Seaborn for data visualisation. Scatterplots were generated to reveal insights into how global health metrics have changed over time, while colour-coding by region provided clear visual distinctions for comparative analysis. Key insights into demographic trends were highlighted to support informed policy recommendations.

**Skills:** data visualisation, data frame, statistical application, Extract-Transform-Load (ETL)

**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Visual Studio Code (offline), matplotib, numpy, Seaborn, Pandas, Excel


## The SQL Case Statement in Employees

**Goal statement:** The objective is to write an  SQL query that extracts the employee number, first name, and last name for the first 100 employees from the database. Additionally, ac calcuated column called "Current - employee" will be included indicating.

 - "Is stiil employed" for active employees.
 - "Not an employee anymore" for former employees.

This query aims to efficiently retrieve and present employee status information for streamlined reporting and analysis.

**Code:**

**Raw Data:** ['Employees raw data'](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/cs4nvueufh97f1oi9592t/employees.sql?rlkey=im4n5ff00ik69g2nfugrwdhk4&e=1&dl=0)

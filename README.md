# Ilyas Mohamed - Data / Business Analyst Portfolio

## About

I am Ilyas, an ambitious individual with a strong background in Business and Mathematics (Joint Honours). With a passion for data analysis and problem-solving, I am currently 
expanding my expertise through Business Intelligence courses on Udemy.

My journey in programming has equipped me with essential skills such as Python, Data Visualisation, Forecasting, and Mathematical Concepts. Alongside technical skills, I have
also developed strong Business Analysis capabilities, including defining business problems, gathering and analysing data, and effectively communicating insights to stakeholders.

In my current role as a Part-time Assistant Accountant, I help clients navigate financial challenges, such as Tax Returns, Business Registrations, and Tax Assessments.
I am enthusiastic about exploring emerging technologies and advancing my skills in programming. 

My ultimate goal is to become a professional Freelance Data & Business Analyst, supporting businesses in driving innovation and improving their impact on society.
I believe that with dedication, continuous learning, and perseverance, I can help businesses unlock their full potential for a better world.
